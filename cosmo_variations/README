So here's the thing, this tarball contains a correction factor for each deltasigma profile
the first value is the multiplicative factor to rescale the DeltaSigma, and also the Covariance with the square of this value (edited)
the last value is the multiplicative factor to rescale the radius
the third value is the Sigma_crit^-1 at the new cosmology, I think you need this for kappa
