The files here compute the multiplicative bias from biases in the photo-z measurements. They take in the intput file and make interpolate the data to compute `1+delta(z)` at the redshifts of our samples.

Also, the file `sigma_crit_inv.txt` is located here. This contains the sigma_crit_inverses for each bin. Errors are discarded because the measurement is precise at the 0.1% level.
